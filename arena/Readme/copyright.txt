Fathom

Fathom is a stand-alone Syzygy based probing tool and API by Basil Falcinelli, introduced in 
November 2015 along with his Gull 3 release [17]. Unlike the original tbprobe code, Fathom 
does not necessarily require the callee to provide move generation functionality. The new 
modifications and extensions to Ronald de Man's original code which can be "redistributed 
and/or modified without restrictions", are released under the permissive MIT License. 
The API consists of three functions [18]:

    tb_init initializes the tablebase
    tb_probe_wdl probes the Win-Draw-Loss (WDL) table for a given position
    tb_probe_root probes the Distance-To-Zero (DTZ) table for the given position

Fathom was modified by Martin Blume to display distance values (DTZ50), source included.
