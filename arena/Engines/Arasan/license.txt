Notes: 

The source code for Arasan includes optional support for both Gaviota
and Nalimov tablebases. Nalimov tablebase support requires use of the
egtb.cpp file, which is copyrighted by Eugene Nalimov, and the tbdecode.h
file, copyrighted by Andrew Katatch. These files are no longer distributed
with the Arasan source. However, Arasan binaries provided by Jon Dart
include the Nalimov tablebase support.

Gaviota tablebase probing code is available separately, under the same
license used by the Arasan chess engine, from
http://sites.google.com/site/gaviotachessengine/Home/endgame-tablebases-1
or from arasanchess.org.

The Arasan user interface, source of which is in the "gui" directory
of the Windows source archive, relies on copyrighted chess fonts and
is not included under this license.

The Arasan Windows GUI (binary and source) and Arasan chess engine
binaries from Jon Dart may be freely distributed, provided that:

1. They are distributed in unmodified form.
2. No more than a nominal fee is charged for copying or media.
